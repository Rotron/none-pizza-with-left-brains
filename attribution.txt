assert-plus
1.0.0 <https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus>
# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number

async-each
1.0.1 <https://github.com/paulmillr/async-each>
# async-each

No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.

We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if you’re using node.js.
* `bower install async-each` if you’re using [Bower](http://bower.io).

## Usage

* `each(array, iterator, callback);` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.

Node.js:

```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});
```

Browser:

```javascript
window.asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
```

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.1.8 <https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion>
# brace-expansion

[Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html), 
as known from sh/bash, in JavaScript.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion)
[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/brace-expansion.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/brace-expansion)
[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/juliangruber/brace-expansion.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion)

## Example

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');

expand('file-{a,b,c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('-v{,,}')
// => ['-v', '-v', '-v']

expand('file{0..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg']

expand('file-{a..c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('file{2..0}.jpg')
// => ['file2.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file0.jpg']

expand('file{0..4..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file2.jpg', 'file4.jpg']

expand('file-{a..e..2}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-c.jpg', 'file-e.jpg']

expand('file{00..10..5}.jpg')
// => ['file00.jpg', 'file05.jpg', 'file10.jpg']

expand('{{A..C},{a..c}}')
// => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'a', 'b', 'c']

expand('ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}')
// => ['ppp', 'pppconfig', 'pppoe', 'pppoeconf']
```

## API

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');
```

### var expanded = expand(str)

Return an array of all possible and valid expansions of `str`. If none are
found, `[str]` is returned.

Valid expansions are:

```js
/^(.*,)+(.+)?$/
// {a,b,...}
```

A comma seperated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

A numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
If `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded
to have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

An alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
`x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a
number.

For compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install brace-expansion
```

> A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / fsevents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/chokidar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on OS X.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on OS X.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for [brunch](http://brunch.io) (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On Mac OS X, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

    npm install chokidar --save

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also 
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable "python" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

configstore
3.1.1 <https://github.com/yeoman/configstore>
# configstore [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yeoman/configstore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yeoman/configstore)

> Easily load and persist config without having to think about where and how

Config is stored in a JSON file located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config`.<br>
Example: `~/.config/configstore/some-id.json`

*If you need this for Electron, check out [`electron-store`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store) instead.*


## Usage

```js
const Configstore = require('configstore');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

// create a Configstore instance with an unique ID e.g.
// Package name and optionally some default values
const conf = new Configstore(pkg.name, {foo: 'bar'});

console.log(conf.get('foo'));
//=> 'bar'

conf.set('awesome', true);
console.log(conf.get('awesome'));
//=> true

// Use dot-notation to access nested properties
conf.set('bar.baz', true);
console.log(conf.get('bar'));
//=> {baz: true}

conf.delete('awesome');
console.log(conf.get('awesome'));
//=> undefined
```


## API

### Configstore(packageName, [defaults], [options])

Returns a new instance.

#### packageName

Type: `string`

Name of your package.

#### defaults

Type: `Object`

Default config.

#### options

##### globalConfigPath

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Store the config at `$CONFIG/package-name/config.json` instead of the default `$CONFIG/configstore/package-name.json`. This is not recommended as you might end up conflicting with other tools, rendering the "without having to think" idea moot.

### Instance

You can use [dot-notation](https://github.com/sindresorhus/dot-prop) in a `key` to access nested properties.

### .set(key, value)

Set an item.

### .set(object)

Set multiple items at once.

### .get(key)

Get an item.

### .has(key)

Check if an item exists.

### .delete(key)

Delete an item.

### .clear()

Delete all items.

### .size

Get the item count.

### .path

Get the path to the config file. Can be used to show the user where the config file is located or even better open it for them.

### .all

Get all the config as an object or replace the current config with an object:

```js
conf.all = {
	hello: 'world'
};
```

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

imurmurhash
0.1.4 <https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js>
iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

jsonify
0.0.0 <https://github.com/substack/jsonify>
jsonify
=======

This module provides Douglas Crockford's JSON implementation without modifying
any globals.

`stringify` and `parse` are merely exported without respect to whether or not a
global `JSON` object exists.

methods
=======

var json = require('jsonify');

json.parse(source, reviver)
---------------------------

Return a new javascript object from a parse of the `source` string.

If a `reviver` function is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value
pair to `reviver.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before
parsing it.

json.stringify(value, replacer, space)
--------------------------------------

Return a string representation for `value`.

If `replacer` is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value pair to
`replacer.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before stringifying
it.

If `space` is a number, indent the result by that many spaces.
If `space` is a string, use `space` as the indentation.

nodemon
1.14.11 <https://github.com/remy/nodemon>
![nodemon logo](http://nodemon.io/nodemon.svg)

# nodemon

For use during development of a node.js based application.

nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.

nodemon does **not** require *any* changes to your code or method of development. nodemon simply wraps your node application and keeps an eye on any files that have changed. Remember that nodemon is a replacement wrapper for `node`, think of it as replacing the word "node" on the command line when you run your script.

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nodemon.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/nodemon)
[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/remy/nodemon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/remy/nodemon) [![Backers on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/backers/badge.svg)](#backers) [![Sponsors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/sponsors/badge.svg)](#sponsors)

# Installation

Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.

You can also install nodemon as a developement dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

With a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.

# Usage

nodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:

```bash
nodemon [your node app]
```

For CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:

```bash
nodemon -h
```

Using nodemon is simple, if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments, I would start it as so:

```bash
nodemon ./server.js localhost 8080
```

Any output from this script is prefixed with `[nodemon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.

If no script is given, nodemon will test for a `package.json` file and if found, will run the file associated with the *main* property ([ref](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/14)).

You can also pass the `inspect` flag to node through the command line as you would normally:

```bash
nodemon --inspect ./server.js 80
```

If you have a `package.json` file for your app, you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the `package.json` for the `main` property and use that value as the app.

nodemon will also search for the `scripts.start` property in `package.json` (as of nodemon 1.1.x).

Also check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) or [issues](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues) for nodemon.

## Automatic re-running

nodemon was originally written to restart hanging processes such as web servers, but now supports apps that cleanly exit. If your script exits cleanly, nodemon will continue to monitor the directory (or directories) and restart the script if there are any changes.

## Manual restarting

Whilst nodemon is running, if you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart nodemon, you can simply type `rs` with a carriage return, and nodemon will restart your process.

## Config files

nodemon supports local and global configuration files. These are usually named `nodemon.json` and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory. An alternative local configuration file can be specified with the `--config <file>` option.

The specificity is as follows, so that a command line argument will always override the config file settings:

- command line arguments
- local config
- global config

A config file can take any of the command line arguments as JSON key values, for example:

```json
{
  "verbose": true,
  "ignore": ["*.test.js", "fixtures/*"],
  "execMap": {
    "rb": "ruby",
    "pde": "processing --sketch={{pwd}} --run"
  }
}
```

The above `nodemon.json` file might be my global config so that I have support for ruby files and processing files, and I can simply run `nodemon demo.pde` and nodemon will automatically know how to run the script even though out of the box support for processing scripts.

A further example of options can be seen in [sample-nodemon.md](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md)

### package.json

If you want to keep all your package configurations in one place, nodemon supports using `package.json` for configuration.
Simply specify the config in the same format as you would for a config file but under `nodemonConfig` in the `package.json` file, for example, take the following `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "nodemon",
  "homepage": "http://nodemon.io",
  "...": "... other standard package.json values",
  "nodemonConfig": {
    "ignore": ["test/*", "docs/*"],
    "delay": "2500"
  }
}
```

Note that if you specify a `--config` file or provide a local `nodemon.json` any `package.json` config is ignored.

*This section needs better documentation, but for now you can also see `nodemon --help config` ([also here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/cli/config.txt))*.

## Using nodemon as a module

Please see [doc/requireable.md](doc/requireable.md)

## Running non-node scripts

nodemon can also be used to execute and monitor other programs. nodemon will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of .js if there's no `nodemon.json`:

```bash
nodemon --exec "python -v" ./app.py
```

Now nodemon will run `app.py` with python in verbose mode (note that if you're not passing args to the exec program, you don't need the quotes), and look for new or modified files with the `.py` extension.

### Default executables

Using the `nodemon.json` config file, you can define your own default executables using the `execMap` property. This is particularly useful if you're working with a language that isn't supported by default by nodemon.

To add support for nodemon to know about the .pl extension (for Perl), the nodemon.json file would add:

```json
{
  "execMap": {
    "pl": "perl"
  }
}
```

Now running the following, nodemon will know to use `perl` as the executable:

```bash
nodemon script.pl
```

It's generally recommended to use the global `nodemon.json` to add your own `execMap` options. However, if there's a common default that's missing, this can be merged in to the project so that nodemon supports it by default, by changing [default.js](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/lib/config/defaults.js) and sending a pull request.

## Monitoring multiple directories

By default nodemon monitors the current working directory. If you want to take control of that option, use the `--watch` option to add specific paths:

```bash
nodemon --watch app --watch libs app/server.js
```

Now nodemon will only restart if there are changes in the `./app` or `./libs` directory. By default nodemon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.

Don't use unix globbing to pass multiple directories, e.g `--watch ./lib/*`, it won't work. You need a `--watch` flag per directory watched.

## Specifying extension watch list

By default, nodemon looks for files with the `.js`, `.mjs`, `.coffee`, `.litcoffee`, and `.json` extensions. If you use the `--exec` option and monitor `app.py` nodemon will monitor files with the extension of `.py`. However, you can specify your own list with the `-e` (or `--ext`) switch like so:

```bash
nodemon -e js,jade
```

Now nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions .js, .jade.

## Ignoring files

By default, nodemon will only restart when a `.js` JavaScript file changes. In some cases you will want to ignore some specific files, directories or file patterns, to prevent nodemon from prematurely restarting your application.

This can be done via the command line:

```bash
nodemon --ignore lib/ --ignore tests/
```

Or specific files can be ignored:

```bash
nodemon --ignore lib/app.js
```

Patterns can also be ignored (but be sure to quote the arguments):

```bash
nodemon --ignore 'lib/*.js'
```

Note that by default, nodemon will ignore the `.git`, `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `.nyc_output`, `coverage` and `.sass-cache` directories and *add* your ignored patterns to the list. If you want to indeed watch a directory like `node_modules`, you need to [override the underlying default ignore rules](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules).

## Application isn't restarting

In some networked environments (such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive), you will need to use the `legacyWatch: true` which enables Chokidar's polling.

Via the CLI, use either `--legacy-watch` or `-L` for short:

```bash
nodemon -L
```

Though this should be a last resort as it will poll every file it can find.

## Delaying restarting

In some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.

To add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:

```bash
nodemon --delay 10 server.js
```

For more precision, milliseconds can be specified.  Either as a float:

```bash
nodemon --delay 2.5 server.js
```

Or using the time specifier (ms):

```bash
nodemon --delay 2500ms server.js
```

The delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the *last* file change.

If you are setting this value in `nodemon.json`, the value will always be interpretted in milliseconds. E.g., the following are equivalent:

```bash
nodemon --delay 2.5

{
  "delay": "2500"
}
```

## Controlling shutdown of your script

nodemon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update. If you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself.

The following example will listen once for the `SIGUSR2` signal (used by nodemon to restart), run the clean up process and then kill itself for nodemon to continue control:

```js
process.once('SIGUSR2', function () {
  gracefulShutdown(function () {
    process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGUSR2');
  });
});
```

Note that the `process.kill` is *only* called once your shutdown jobs are complete. Hat tip to [Benjie Gillam](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2011/08/node-js-clean-restart-and-faster-development-with-nodemon/) for writing this technique up.

## Triggering events when nodemon state changes

If you want growl like notifications when nodemon restarts or to trigger an action when an event happens, then you can either `require` nodemon or simply add event actions to your `nodemon.json` file.

For example, to trigger a notification on a Mac when nodemon restarts, `nodemon.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "events": {
    "restart": "osascript -e 'display notification \"app restarted\" with title \"nodemon\"'"
  }
}
```

A full list of available events is listed on the [event states wiki](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/wiki/Events#states). Note that you can bind to both states and messages.

## Pipe output to somewhere else

```js
nodemon({
  script: ...,
  stdout: false // important: this tells nodemon not to output to console
}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up
  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));
  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));
});
```

## Using nodemon in your gulp workflow

Check out the [gulp-nodemon](https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's gulp workflow.

## Using nodemon in your Grunt workflow

Check out the [grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's grunt workflow.

## Pronunciation

> nodemon, is it pronounced: node-mon, no-demon or node-e-mon (like pokémon)?

Well...I've been asked this many times before. I like that I've been asked this before. There's been bets as to which one it actually is.

The answer is simple, but possibly frustrating. I'm not saying (how I pronounce it). It's up to you to call it as you like. All answers are correct :)

## Design principles

- Less flags is better
- Works across all platforms
- Less features
- Let individuals build on top of nodemon
- Offer all CLI functionality as an API
- Contributions must have and pass tests

Nodemon is not perfect, and CLI arguments has sprawled beyond where I'm completely happy, but perhaps it can be reduced a little one day.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

1.3.2 <https://github.com/bestiejs/punycode.js>
# Punycode.js [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/bestiejs/punycode.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bestiejs/punycode.js) [![Code coverage status](http://img.shields.io/coveralls/bestiejs/punycode.js/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/bestiejs/punycode.js) [![Dependency status](https://gemnasium.com/bestiejs/punycode.js.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/bestiejs/punycode.js)

A robust Punycode converter that fully complies to [RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492) and [RFC 5891](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891), and works on nearly all JavaScript platforms.

This JavaScript library is the result of comparing, optimizing and documenting different open-source implementations of the Punycode algorithm:

* [The C example code from RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492#appendix-C)
* [`punycode.c` by _Markus W. Scherer_ (IBM)](http://opensource.apple.com/source/ICU/ICU-400.42/icuSources/common/punycode.c)
* [`punycode.c` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/punycode/blob/master/punycode.c)
* [JavaScript implementation by _some_](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183485/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-free-javascript-for-punycode-to-unicode-conversion/301287#301287)
* [`punycode.js` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/426298c8c1c0d5b5224ac3658c41e7c2a3fe9377/lib/punycode.js) (note: [not fully compliant](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2072))

This project is [bundled](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/punycode.js) with [Node.js v0.6.2+](https://github.com/joyent/node/compare/975f1930b1...61e796decc).

## Installation

Via [npm](http://npmjs.org/) (only required for Node.js releases older than v0.6.2):

```bash
npm install punycode
```

Via [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```bash
bower install punycode
```

Via [Component](https://github.com/component/component):

```bash
component install bestiejs/punycode.js
```

In a browser:

```html
<script src="punycode.js"></script>
```

In [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org/):

```js
var punycode = require('punycode');
```

In [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):

```js
load('punycode.js');
```

Using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):

```js
require(
  {
    'paths': {
      'punycode': 'path/to/punycode'
    }
  },
  ['punycode'],
  function(punycode) {
    console.log(punycode);
  }
);
```

## API

### `punycode.decode(string)`

Converts a Punycode string of ASCII symbols to a string of Unicode symbols.

```js
// decode domain name parts
punycode.decode('maana-pta'); // 'mañana'
punycode.decode('--dqo34k'); // '☃-⌘'
```

### `punycode.encode(string)`

Converts a string of Unicode symbols to a Punycode string of ASCII symbols.

```js
// encode domain name parts
punycode.encode('mañana'); // 'maana-pta'
punycode.encode('☃-⌘'); // '--dqo34k'
```

### `punycode.toUnicode(input)`

Converts a Punycode string representing a domain name or an email address to Unicode. Only the Punycoded parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it on a string that has already been converted to Unicode.

```js
// decode domain names
punycode.toUnicode('xn--maana-pta.com');
// → 'mañana.com'
punycode.toUnicode('xn----dqo34k.com');
// → '☃-⌘.com'

// decode email addresses
punycode.toUnicode('джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq');
// → 'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa'
```

### `punycode.toASCII(input)`

Converts a Unicode string representing a domain name or an email address to Punycode. Only the non-ASCII parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it with a domain that's already in ASCII.

```js
// encode domain names
punycode.toASCII('mañana.com');
// → 'xn--maana-pta.com'
punycode.toASCII('☃-⌘.com');
// → 'xn----dqo34k.com'

// encode email addresses
punycode.toASCII('джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa');
// → 'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq'
```

### `punycode.ucs2`

#### `punycode.ucs2.decode(string)`

Creates an array containing the numeric code point values of each Unicode symbol in the string. While [JavaScript uses UCS-2 internally](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), this function will convert a pair of surrogate halves (each of which UCS-2 exposes as separate characters) into a single code point, matching UTF-16.

```js
punycode.ucs2.decode('abc');
// → [0x61, 0x62, 0x63]
// surrogate pair for U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE:
punycode.ucs2.decode('\uD834\uDF06');
// → [0x1D306]
```

#### `punycode.ucs2.encode(codePoints)`

Creates a string based on an array of numeric code point values.

```js
punycode.ucs2.encode([0x61, 0x62, 0x63]);
// → 'abc'
punycode.ucs2.encode([0x1D306]);
// → '\uD834\uDF06'
```

### `punycode.version`

A string representing the current Punycode.js version number.

## Unit tests & code coverage

After cloning this repository, run `npm install --dev` to install the dependencies needed for Punycode.js development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.

Once that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, PhantomJS, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.

To generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.

Feel free to fork if you see possible improvements!

update-notifier
2.3.0 <https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier>
# update-notifier [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yeoman/update-notifier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yeoman/update-notifier)

> Update notifications for your CLI app

![](screenshot.png)

Inform users of your package of updates in a non-intrusive way.

#### Contents

- [Install](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [How](#how)
- [API](#api)
- [About](#about)
- [Users](#users)


## Install

```
$ npm install update-notifier
```


## Usafe

### Simple

```js
const updateNotifier = require('update-notifier');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

updateNotifier({pkg}).notify();
```

### Comprehensive

```js
const updateNotifier = require('update-notifier');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

// Checks for available update and returns an instance
const notifier = updateNotifier({pkg});

// Notify using the built-in convenience method
notifier.notify();

// `notifier.update` contains some useful info about the update
console.log(notifier.update);
/*
{
	latest: '1.0.1',
	current: '1.0.0',
	type: 'patch', // Possible values: latest, major, minor, patch, prerelease, build
	name: 'pageres'
}
*/
```

### Options and custom message

```js
const notifier = updateNotifier({
	pkg,
	updateCheckInterval: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 1 week
});

if (notifier.update) {
	console.log(`Update available: ${notifier.update.latest}`);
}
```


## How

Whenever you initiate the update notifier and it's not within the interval threshold, it will asynchronously check with npm in the background for available updates, then persist the result. The next time the notifier is initiated, the result will be loaded into the `.update` property. This prevents any impact on your package startup performance.
The update check is done in a unref'ed [child process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options). This means that if you call `process.exit`, the check will still be performed in its own process.

The first time the user runs your app, it will check for an update, and even if an update is available, it will wait the specified `updateCheckInterval` before notifying the user. This is done to not be annoying to the user, but might surprise you as an implementer if you're testing whether it works. Check out [`example.js`](example.js) to quickly test out `update-notifier` and see how you can test that it works in your app.


## API

### notifier = updateNotifier(options)

Checks if there is an available update. Accepts options defined below. Returns an instance with an `.update` property there is an available update, otherwise `undefined`.

### options

#### pkg

Type: `Object`

##### name

*Required*<br>
Type: `string`

##### version

*Required*<br>
Type: `string`

#### updateCheckInterval

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `1000 * 60 * 60 * 24` *(1 day)*

How often to check for updates.

#### callback(error, update)

Type: `Function`

Passing a callback here will make it check for an update directly and report right away. Not recommended as you won't get the benefits explained in [`How`](#how). `update` is equal to `notifier.update`.

### notifier.notify([options])

Convenience method to display a notification message. *(See screenshot)*

Only notifies if there is an update and the process is [TTY](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_tty_terminals_and_process_stdout).

#### options

Type: `Object`

##### defer

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Defer showing the notification to after the process has exited.

##### message

Type: `string`<br>
Default: [See above screenshot](https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier#update-notifier-)

Message that will be shown when an update is available.

##### isGlobal

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Include the `-g` argument in the default message's `npm i` recommendation. You may want to change this if your CLI package can be installed as a dependency of another project, and don't want to recommend a global installation. This option is ignored if you supply your own `message` (see above).

##### boxenOpts

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `{padding: 1, margin: 1, align: 'center', borderColor: 'yellow', borderStyle: 'round'}` *(See screenshot)*

Options object that will be passed to [`boxen`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/boxen).

### User settings

Users of your module have the ability to opt-out of the update notifier by changing the `optOut` property to `true` in `~/.config/configstore/update-notifier-[your-module-name].json`. The path is available in `notifier.config.path`.

Users can also opt-out by [setting the environment variable](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/set-environment-variables.md) `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` with any value or by using the `--no-update-notifier` flag on a per run basis.


## About

The idea for this module came from the desire to apply the browser update strategy to CLI tools, where everyone is always on the latest version. We first tried automatic updating, which we discovered wasn't popular. This is the second iteration of that idea, but limited to just update notifications.


## Users

There are a bunch projects using it:

- [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) - Package manager for JavaScript
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) - Modern workflows for modern webapps
- [AVA](https://ava.li) - Simple concurrent test runner
- [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) - JavaScript happiness style linter
- [Pageres](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres) - Capture website screenshots
- [Node GH](http://nodegh.io) - GitHub command line tool

[And 1600+ more…](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/update-notifier)

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

asn1.js
4.9.2 <https://github.com/indutny/asn1.js>
# ASN1.js

ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.

## Example

Define model:

```javascript
var asn = require('asn1.js');

var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('firstName').octstr(),
    this.key('lastName').octstr(),
    this.key('age').int(),
    this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),
    this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)
  );
});

var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('time').gentime(),
    this.key('description').octstr()
  );
});
```

Encode data:

```javascript
var output = Human.encode({
  firstName: 'Thomas',
  lastName: 'Anderson',
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio: [
    {
      time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
      description: 'freedom of mind'
    }
  ]
}, 'der');
```

Decode data:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
console.log(human);
/*
{ firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,
  lastName: <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio:
   [ { time: 922820400000,
       description: <Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f 66 20 6d 69 6e 64> } ] }
*/
```

### Partial decode

Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,
you should call:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
console.log(human);
/*
{ result: { ... },
  errors: [ ... ] }
*/
```

bn.js
4.11.8 <https://github.com/indutny/bn.js>
# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />

> BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js
const BN = require('bn.js');

var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

The only available postfix at the moment is:

* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

createECDH [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crypto-browserify/createECDH.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/crypto-browserify/createECDH)
====

In io.js or node >= 0.11 this module is just a shortcut to crypto.createECDH.  In node <= 0.11 or the browser this is a pure JavaScript implimentation, more specifically a wrapper around [elliptic](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic), to give it the same API as node. `secp256k1`, `secp224r1` (aka p224), `prime256v1` (aka p256, secp256r1), `prime192v1` (aka p192, secp192r1), `secp384r1` (aka p384), `secp521r1` (aka p521)  curves all work in both this library and node (though only the highlighted name will work in node).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crypto-browserify/createHash.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/crypto-browserify/createHash)

Node style hashes for use in the browser, with native hash functions in node. Api is the same as hashes in node:

```js
var createHash = require('create-hash');
var hash = createHash('sha224');
hash.update('synchronous write'); //optional encoding parameter
hash.digest();// synchronously get result with optional encoding parameter

hash.write('write to it as a stream');
hash.end();//remember it's a stream
hash.read();//only if you ended it as a stream though
```

To get the JavaScript version even in node do `require('create-hash/browser');`

detect-node
2.0.3 <https://github.com/iliakan/detect-node>
Usage:
```js
var isNode = require('detect-node');

if (isNode) {
  console.log("Running under Node.JS");
} else {
  alert("Hello from browser (or whatever not-a-node env)");
}
```

The check is performed as:
```js
module.exports = false;

// Only Node.JS has a process variable that is of [[Class]] process
try {
 module.exports = Object.prototype.toString.call(global.process) === '[object process]' 
} catch(e) {}

```

Thanks to Ingvar Stepanyan for the initial idea. This check is both **the most reliable I could find** and it does not use `process` env directly, which would cause browserify to include it into the build.

In node just returns an object with `crypto.createDiffieHellman` and `crypto.getDiffieHellman` in the browser returns a shim. To require the pure JavaScript one in node `require('diffie-hellman/browser');`;

[![Saucelabs Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/gh-indutny-elliptic.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/gh-indutny-elliptic)

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign message (must be an array, or it'll be treated as a hex sequence)
var msg = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msg);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msg, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Public key as '04 + x + y'
var pub = '04bb1fa3...';

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) hex-string of DER-encoded signature; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s)

var signature = 'b102ac...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msg, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign message (must be an array, or it'll be treated as a hex sequence)
var msg = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msg).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msg, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msg, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

enhanced-resolve
3.4.1 <https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve>
# enhanced-resolve

Offers an async require.resolve function. It's highly configurable.

## Features

* plugin system
* provide a custom filesystem
* sync and async node.js filesystems included


## Getting Started
### Install
```sh
# npm
npm install enhanced-resolve
# or Yarn
yarn add enhanced-resolve
```

### Creating a Resolver
The easiest way to create a resolver is to use the `createResolver` function on `ResolveFactory`, along with one of the supplied File System implementations.
```js
const {
  NodeJsInputFileSystem,
  CachedInputFileSystem,
  ResolverFactory
} = require('enhanced-resolve');

// create a resolver
const myResolver = ResolverFactory.createResolver({
  // Typical usage will consume the `NodeJsInputFileSystem` + `CachedInputFileSystem`, which wraps the Node.js `fs` wrapper to add resilience + caching.
  fileSystem: new CachedInputFileSystem(new NodeJsInputFileSystem(), 4000),
  extensions: ['.js', '.json']
  /* any other resolver options here. Options/defaults can be seen below */
});

// resolve a file with the new resolver
const context = {};
const lookupStartPath = '/Users/webpack/some/root/dir';
const request = './path/to-look-up.js';
myResolver.resolve({}, lookupStartPath, request, (err/*Error*/, filepath/*string*/) => {
  // Do something with the path
});
```

For more examples creating different types resolvers (sync/async, context, etc) see `lib/node.js`.
#### Resolver Options
| Field                    | Default                     | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| modules                  | ["node_modules"]            | A list of directories to resolve modules from, can be absolute path or folder name |
| descriptionFiles         | ["package.json"]            | A list of description files to read from |

| enforceExtension         | false                       | Enforce that a extension from extensions must be used |
| moduleExtensions         | []                          | A list of module extensions which should be tried for modules |
| enforceModuleExtension   | false                       | Enforce that a extension from moduleExtensions must be used |
| alias                    | []                          | A list of module alias configurations or an object which maps key to value |
| resolveToContext         | false                       | Resolve to a context instead of a file |

| cacheWithContext         | true                        | If unsafe cache is enabled, includes `request.context` in the cache key  |
| cachePredicate           | function() { return true }; | A function which decides whether a request should be cached or not. An object is passed to the function with `path` and `request` properties. |
| fileSystem               |                             | The file system which should be used |
| resolver                 | undefined                   | A prepared Resolver to which the plugins are attached |

## Plugins
Similar to `webpack`, the core of `enhanced-resolve` functionality is implemented as individual plugins that are executed using [`Tapable`](https://github.com/webpack/tapable). These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.

A plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.

### Plugin Boilerplate
```js
class MyResolverPlugin {
  constructor(source, target) {
    this.source = source;
    this.target = target;
  }

  apply(resolver) {
    resolver.plugin(this.source, (request, callback) => {
      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here
      resolver.doResolve(this.target, request, null, callback);
    });
  }
}
```

Plugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.

## Tests

``` javascript
npm test
```

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve)


## Passing options from webpack
If you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:

```
resolve: {
  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],
  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],
  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]
  ...
},
```

<a name="errnoexposed"></a>
## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

esrecurse
4.2.0 <https://github.com/estools/esrecurse>
### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behavoir of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

faye-websocket
0.11.1 <https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node>
# faye-websocket

* Travis CI build: [![Build
  status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node)
* Autobahn tests: [server](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/servers/),
  [client](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/clients/)

This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building
WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but
rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing
[Node](https://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction
other than the standard [WebSocket
API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#network).

It also provides an abstraction for handling
[EventSource](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events)
connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to
the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access
via proxies than WebSockets.


## Installation

```
$ npm install faye-websocket
```


## Handling WebSocket connections in Node

You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade
requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes
the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this
is how you'd implement an echo server:

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    http      = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {
  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {
    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);
    
    ws.on('message', function(event) {
      ws.send(event.data);
    });
    
    ws.on('close', function(event) {
      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
      ws = null;
    });
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the
`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:

```js
    ws.pipe(ws);
```

Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting
through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you
call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire
handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer
the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any
buffered messages will be sent to the client.

If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the
`onopen` event.

If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to
send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a
message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message
is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the
client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns
`false`.

```js
ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {
  // fires when pong is received
});
```


## Using the WebSocket client

The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`
protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web
browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');

ws.on('open', function(event) {
  console.log('open');
  ws.send('Hello, world!');
});

ws.on('message', function(event) {
  console.log('message', event.data);
});

ws.on('close', function(event) {
  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
  ws = null;
});
```

The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the
handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.

To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,
including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you
require. Only the `origin` setting is required.

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {
  proxy: {
    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',
    headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},
    tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}
  }
});
```

The `tls` value is an object that will be passed to
[`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).


## Subprotocol negotiation

The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application
protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which
protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you
construct the socket:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server
supports after the other constructor arguments:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side
socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.


## Protocol extensions

faye-websocket is based on the
[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an
array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add
[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):

```js
var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');

var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]});
```


## Initialization options

Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in
at initialization time, for example:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);
var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);
```

`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.
`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:

* `extensions` - an array of
  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
  compatible extensions, as described above
* `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to
  be sent during the handshake process
* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.
  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.
* `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,
  measured in seconds

The client accepts some additional options:

* `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above
* `net` - an object containing settings for the origin server that will be
  passed to
  [`net.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_connect_options_connectlistener)
* `tls` - an object containing TLS settings for the origin server, this will be
  passed to
  [`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)
* `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`


## WebSocket API

Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.

* <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is
  established. Event has no attributes.
* <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a
  message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`
  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).
* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error
  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,
  you do not need to implement error recover.
* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the
  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>
  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer
  that closed the connection.
* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a
  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.
* <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional
  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.
* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status
  code and reason text, both of which are optional.
* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`
  protocol the connection is using.
* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol
  the socket is using.


## Handling EventSource connections in Node

EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they
only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.
EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each
message has an optional event-type and ID.

```js
var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),
    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,
    http        = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {
    var es = new EventSource(request, response);
    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);
    
    // Periodically send messages
    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);
    
    es.on('close', function() {
      clearInterval(loop);
      es = null;
    });
  
  } else {
    // Normal HTTP request
    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    response.end('Hello');
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default
event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`
event with ID `99`:

```js
es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});
```

The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:

* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the
  EventSource.
* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the
  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection
  to determine which messages need resending.

When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass
configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:

* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the
  EventSource response.
* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it
  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.
* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send
  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts
  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.

For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings
every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:

```js
var es = new EventSource(request, response, {
  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},
  ping:    15,
  retry:   10
});
```

You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike
WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send
some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.

killable
1.0.0 <https://github.com/marten-de-vries/killable>
killable
========

Keeps track of a server's open sockets so they can be destroyed at a
moment's notice. This way, the server connection can be killed very
fast.

Installation
------------

```
npm install killable
```

Example usage
-------------

Using express:
('server' in the example is just an ``http.server``, so other frameworks
or pure Node should work just as well.)

```javascript
var killable = require('killable');

var app = require('express')();
var server;

app.route('/', function (req, res, next) {
  res.send('Server is going down NOW!');

  server.kill(function () {
    //the server is down when this is called. That won't take long.
  });
});

var server = app.listen(8080);
killable(server);
```

API
---

The ``killable`` module is callable. When you call it on a Node
``http.Server`` object, it will add a ``server.kill()`` method on it. It
returns the server object.

``server.kill([callback])`` closes all open sockets and calls
``server.close()``, to which the ``callback`` is passed on.

loglevel
1.6.1 <https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel>

# loglevel [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/loglevel.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loglevel) [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/pimterry/loglevel.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pimterry/loglevel) [![Coveralls percentage](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/pimterry/loglevel.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/pimterry/loglevel?branch=master)

[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/loglevel.svg?style=flat
[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/loglevel

Minimal lightweight simple logging for JavaScript. loglevel replaces console.log() and friends with level-based logging and filtering, with none of console's downsides.

This is a barebones reliable everyday logging library. It does not do fancy things, it does not let you reconfigure appenders or add complex log filtering rules or boil tea (more's the pity), but it does have the all core functionality that you actually use:

## Features

### Simple

* Log things at a given level (trace/debug/info/warn/error) to the console object (as seen in all modern browsers & node.js)
* Filter logging by level (all the above or 'silent'), so you can disable all but error logging in production, and then run log.setLevel("trace") in your console to turn it all back on for a furious debugging session
* Single file, no dependencies, weighs in at 1.1KB minified and gzipped

### Effective

* Log methods gracefully fall back to simpler console logging methods if more specific ones aren't available: so calls to log.debug() go to console.debug() if possible, or console.log() if not
* Logging calls still succeed even if there's no console object at all, so your site doesn't break when people visit with old browsers that don't support the console object (here's looking at you IE) and similar
* This then comes together giving a consistent reliable API that works in every JavaScript environment with a console available, and never breaks anything anywhere else

### Convenient

* Log output keeps line numbers: most JS logging frameworks call console.log methods through wrapper functions, clobbering your stacktrace and making the extra info many browsers provide useless. We'll have none of that thanks.
* It works with all the standard JavaScript loading systems out of the box (CommonJS, AMD, or just as a global)
* Logging is filtered to "warn" level by default, to keep your live site clean in normal usage (or you can trivially re-enable everything with an initial log.enableAll() call)
* Magically handles situations where console logging is not initially available (IE8/9), and automatically enables logging as soon as it does become available (when developer console is opened)
* Extensible, to add other log redirection, filtering, or formatting functionality, while keeping all the above (except you will clobber your stacktrace, see Plugins below)

## Downloading loglevel

If you're using NPM, you can just run `npm install loglevel`.

Alternatively, loglevel is also available via [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) (`bower install loglevel`), as a [Webjar](http://www.webjars.org/), or an [Atmosphere package](https://atmospherejs.com/spacejamio/loglevel) (for Meteor)

Alternatively if you just want to grab the file yourself, you can download either the current stable [production version][min] or the [development version][max] directly, or reference it remotely on unpkg at [`https://unpkg.com/loglevel/dist/loglevel.min.js`][cdn] (this will redirect to a latest version, use the resulting redirected URL if you want to pin that version).

Finally, if you want to tweak loglevel to your own needs or you immediately need the cutting-edge version, clone this repo and see [Developing & Contributing](#developing--contributing) below for build instructions.

[min]: https://raw.github.com/pimterry/loglevel/master/dist/loglevel.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/pimterry/loglevel/master/dist/loglevel.js
[cdn]: https://unpkg.com/loglevel/dist/loglevel.min.js

## Setting it up

loglevel supports AMD (e.g. RequireJS), CommonJS (e.g. Node.js) and direct usage (e.g. loading globally with a &lt;script&gt; tag) loading methods. You should be able to do nearly anything, and then skip to the next section anyway and have it work. Just in case though, here's some specific examples that definitely do the right thing:

### CommonsJS (e.g. Node)

```javascript
var log = require('loglevel');
log.warn("unreasonably simple");
```

### AMD (e.g. RequireJS)

```javascript
define(['loglevel'], function(log) {
   log.warn("dangerously convenient");
});
```

### Directly in your web page:

```html
<script src="loglevel.min.js"></script>
<script>
log.warn("too easy");
</script>
```

### As an ES6 module (assuming some transpilation step):

```javascript
import * as log from 'loglevel';
log.warn("ultra-compatible");
```

### With noConflict():

If you're using another JavaScript library that exposes a 'log' global, you can run into conflicts with loglevel.  Similarly to jQuery, you can solve this by putting loglevel into no-conflict mode immediately after it is loaded onto the page. This resets to 'log' global to its value before loglevel was loaded (typically `undefined`), and returns the loglevel object, which you can then bind to another name yourself.

For example:

```html
<script src="loglevel.min.js"></script>
<script>
var logging = log.noConflict();

logging.warn("still pretty easy");
</script>
```

## Documentation

The loglevel API is extremely minimal. All methods are available on the root loglevel object, which it's suggested you name 'log' (this is the default if you import it in globally, and is what's set up in the above examples). The API consists of:

* 5 actual logging methods, ordered and available as:
  * `log.trace(msg)`
  * `log.debug(msg)`
  * `log.info(msg)`
  * `log.warn(msg)`
  * `log.error(msg)`

  `log.log(msg)` is also available, as an alias for `log.debug(msg)`, to improve compatibility with `console`, and make migration easier.

  Exact output formatting of these will depend on the console available in the current context of your application. For example, many environments will include a full stack trace with all trace() calls, and icons or similar to highlight other calls.

  These methods should never fail in any environment, even if no console object is currently available, and should always fall back to an available log method even if the specific method called (e.g. warn) isn't available.

  Be aware that all this means that these method won't necessarily always produce exactly the output you expect in every environment; loglevel only guarantees that these methods will never explode on you, and that it will call the most relevant method it can find, with your argument. Firefox is a notable example here: due to a [current Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1172314) `log.trace(msg)` calls in Firefox will print only the stacktrace, and won't include any passed message arguments.

* A `log.setLevel(level, [persist])` method.

  This disables all logging below the given level, so that after a log.setLevel("warn") call log.warn("something") or log.error("something") will output messages, but log.info("something") will not.

  This can take either a log level name or 'silent' (which disables everything) in one of a few forms:
  * As a log level from the internal levels list, e.g. log.levels.SILENT ← _for type safety_
  * As a string, like 'error' (case-insensitive) ← _for a reasonable practical balance_
  * As a numeric index from 0 (trace) to 5 (silent) ← _deliciously terse, and more easily programmable (...although, why?)_

  Where possible the log level will be persisted. LocalStorage will be used if available, falling back to cookies if not. If neither is available in the current environment (i.e. in Node), or if you pass `false` as the optional 'persist' second argument, persistence will be skipped.

  If log.setLevel() is called when a console object is not available (in IE 8 or 9 before the developer tools have been opened, for example) logging will remain silent until the console becomes available, and then begin logging at the requested level.

* A `log.setDefaultLevel(level)` method.

  This sets the current log level only if one has not been persisted and can’t be loaded. This is useful when initializing scripts; if a developer or user has previously called `setLevel()`, this won’t alter their settings. For example, your application might set the log level to `error` in a production environment, but when debugging an issue, you might call `setLevel("trace")` on the console to see all the logs. If that `error` setting was set using `setDefaultLevel()`, it will still say as `trace` on subsequent page loads and refreshes instead of resetting to `error`.

  The `level` argument takes is the same values that you might pass to `setLevel()`. Levels set using `setDefaultLevel()` never persist to subsequent page loads.

* `log.enableAll()` and `log.disableAll()` methods.

  These enable or disable all log messages, and are equivalent to log.setLevel("trace") and log.setLevel("silent") respectively.

* A `log.getLevel()` method.

  Returns the current logging level, as a number from 0 (trace) to 5 (silent)

  It's very unlikely you'll need to use this for normal application logging; it's provided partly to help plugin development, and partly to let you optimize logging code as below, where debug data is only generated if the level is set such that it'll actually be logged. This probably doesn't affect you, unless you've run profiling on your code and you have hard numbers telling you that your log data generation is a real performance problem.

  ```javascript
  if (log.getLevel() <= log.levels.DEBUG) {
    var logData = runExpensiveDataGeneration();
    log.debug(logData);
  }
  ```

  This notably isn't the right solution to avoid the cost of string concatenation in your logging. Firstly, it's very unlikely that string concatenation in your logging is really an important performance problem. Even if you do genuinely have hard metrics showing that it is though, the better solution that wrapping your log statements in this is to use multiple arguments, as below. The underlying console API will automatically concatenate these for you if logging is enabled, and if it isn't then all log methods are no-ops, and no concatenation will be done at all.

  ```javascript
  // Prints 'My concatenated log message'
  log.debug("My ", "concatenated ", "log message");
  ```

* A `log.getLogger(loggerName)` method.

  This gets you a new logger object that works exactly like the root `log` object, but can have its level and logging methods set independently. All loggers must have a name (which is a non-empty string). Calling `getLogger()` multiple times with the same name will return an identical logger object.

  In large applications, it can be incredibly useful to turn logging on and off for particular modules as you are working with them. Using the `getLogger()` method lets you create a separate logger for each part of your application with its own logging level.

  Likewise, for small, independent modules, using a named logger instead of the default root logger allows developers using your module to selectively turn on deep, trace-level logging when trying to debug problems, while logging only errors or silencing logging altogether under normal circumstances.

  Example usage *(using CommonJS modules, but you could do the same with any module system):*

  ```javascript
  // In module-one.js:
  var log = require("loglevel").getLogger("module-one");
  function doSomethingAmazing() {
    log.debug("Amazing message from module one.");
  }

  // In module-two.js:
  var log = require("loglevel").getLogger("module-two");
  function doSomethingSpecial() {
    log.debug("Special message from module two.");
  }

  // In your main application module:
  var log = require("loglevel");
  var moduleOne = require("module-one");
  var moduleTwo = require("module-two");
  log.getLogger("module-two").setLevel("TRACE");

  moduleOne.doSomethingAmazing();
  moduleTwo.doSomethingSpecial();
  // logs "Special message from module two."
  // (but nothing from module one.)
  ```

  Loggers returned by `getLogger()` support all the same properties and methods as the default root logger, excepting `noConflict()` and the `getLogger()` method itself.

  Like the root logger, other loggers can have their logging level saved. If a logger’s level has not been saved, it will inherit the root logger’s level when it is first created. If the root logger’s level changes later, the new level will not affect other loggers that have already been created.

  Likewise, loggers will inherit the root logger’s `methodFactory`. After creation, each logger can have its `methodFactory` independently set. See the *plugins* section below for more about `methodFactory`.

* A `log.getLoggers()` method.

  This will return you the dictionary of all loggers created with `getLogger`, keyed off of their names.

## Plugins

### Existing plugins:

[loglevel-plugin-prefix](https://github.com/kutuluk/loglevel-plugin-prefix) - plugin for loglevel message prefixing.

[loglevel-plugin-remote](https://github.com/kutuluk/loglevel-plugin-remote) - plugin for sending loglevel messages to a remote log server.

ServerSend - https://github.com/artemyarulin/loglevel-serverSend - Forward your log messages to a remote server.

Standard Streams - https://github.com/NatLibFi/loglevel-std-streams - Route logging through STDERR in Node for easier log management.

Message Prefix - https://github.com/NatLibFi/loglevel-message-prefix - Dynamic (timestamp/level) and static ('foo') message prefixing.

Message Buffer - https://github.com/NatLibFi/loglevel-message-buffer - Buffer messages, and flush them on-demand later.

DEBUG - https://github.com/vectrlabs/loglevel-debug - Control logging from a DEBUG environmental variable (similar to the classic [Debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module)

### Writing plugins:

Loglevel provides a simple reliable minimal base for console logging that works everywhere. This means it doesn't include lots of fancy functionality that might be useful in some cases, such as log formatting and redirection (e.g. also sending log messages to a server over AJAX)

Including that would increase the size and complexity of the library, but more importantly would remove stacktrace information. Currently log methods are either disabled, or enabled with directly bound versions of the console.log methods (where possible). This means your browser shows the log message as coming from your code at the call to `log.info("message!")` not from within loglevel, since it really calls the bound console method directly, without indirection. The indirection required to dynamically format, further filter, or redirect log messages would stop this.

There's clearly enough enthusiasm for this even at that cost though that loglevel now includes a plugin API. To use it, redefine log.methodFactory(methodName, logLevel, loggerName) with a function of your own. This will be called for each enabled method each time the level is set (including initially), and should return a function to be used for the given log method, at the given level, for a logger with the given name. If you'd like to retain all the reliability and features of loglevel, it's recommended that this wraps the initially provided value of `log.methodFactory`

For example, a plugin to prefix all log messages with "Newsflash: " would look like:

```javascript
var originalFactory = log.methodFactory;
log.methodFactory = function (methodName, logLevel, loggerName) {
    var rawMethod = originalFactory(methodName, logLevel, loggerName);

    return function (message) {
        rawMethod("Newsflash: " + message);
    };
};
log.setLevel(log.getLevel()); // Be sure to call setLevel method in order to apply plugin
```

*(The above supports only a single log.warn("") argument for clarity, but it's easy to extend to a [fuller varadic version](http://jsbin.com/xehoye/edit?html,console))*

If you develop and release a plugin, please get in contact! I'd be happy to reference it here for future users. Some consistency is helpful; naming your plugin 'loglevel-PLUGINNAME' (e.g. loglevel-newsflash) is preferred, as is giving it the 'loglevel-plugin' keyword in your package.json

## Developing & Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

Builds can be run with npm: run `npm run dist` to build a distributable version of the project (in /dist), or `npm test` to just run the tests and linting. During development you can run `npm run watch` and it will monitor source files, and rerun the tests and linting as appropriate when they're changed.

_Also, please don't manually edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the "lib" subdirectory!_

You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the 
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to 
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under 
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and

  days: 30, // how long till expiry of the signed certificate (default: 365)
  algorithm: 'sha256', // sign the certificate with specified algorithm (default: 'sha1')
  extensions: [{ name: 'basicConstraints', cA: true }], // certificate extensions array
  pkcs7: true, // include PKCS#7 as part of the output (default: false)
  clientCertificate: true, // generate client cert signed by the original key (default: false)
  clientCertificateCN: 'jdoe' // client certificate's common name (default: 'John Doe jdoe123')
});
```

> You can avoid key pair generation specifying your own keys (`{ keyPair: { publicKey: '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...', privateKey: '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...' }`)

### Generate Client Certificates

If you are in an environment where servers require client certificates, you can generate client keys signed by the original (server) key.

```js
var pems = selfsigned.generate(null, { clientCertificate: true });
console.log(pems)
```

source-list-map
2.0.0 <https://github.com/webpack/source-list-map>
# source-list-map

## API

### Example

``` js
var SourceListMap = require("source-list-map").SourceListMap;

// Create a new map
var map = new SourceListMap();

// Add generated code that is map line to line to some soure
map.add("Generated\ncode1\n", "source-code.js", "Orginal\nsource");

// Add generated code that isn't mapped
map.add("Generated\ncode2\n");

// Get SourceMap and generated source
map.toStringWithSourceMap({ file: "generated-code.js" });
// {
//   source: 'Generated\ncode1\nGenerated\ncode2\n',
//   map: {
//      version: 3,
//      file: 'generated-code.js',
//      sources: [ 'source-code.js' ],
//      sourcesContent: [ 'Orginal\nsource' ],
//      mappings: 'AAAA;AACA;;;'
//    }
// }

// Convert existing SourceMap into SourceListMap
// (Only the first mapping per line is preserved)
var fromStringWithSourceMap = require("source-list-map").fromStringWithSourceMap;
var map = fromStringWithSourceMap("Generated\ncode", { version: 3, ... });

```

### `new SourceListMap()`

### `SourceListMap.prototype.add`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.add(generatedCode: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.add(generatedCode: string, source: string, originalSource: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.add(sourceListMap: SourceListMap)
```

Append some stuff.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.prepend`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.prepend(generatedCode: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.prepend(generatedCode: string, source: string, originalSource: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.prepend(sourceListMap: SourceListMap)
```

Prepend some stuff.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.toString()`

Get generated code.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap(options: object)
```

Get generated code and SourceMap. `options` can contains `file` property which defines the `file` property of the SourceMap.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.mapGeneratedCode`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.mapGeneratedCode(fn: function) : SourceListMap
```

Applies `fn` to each generated code block (per line). The returned value is set as new generated code. Returns a new SourceListMap.

Removing and adding lines is supported. The SourceMap complexity will increase when doing this.

# SPDY Server for node.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/spdy.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/spdy)
[![dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy/status.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy)

[![Waffle](https://img.shields.io/badge/track-waffle-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://waffle.io/spdy-http2/node-spdy)

With this module you can create [HTTP2][0] / [SPDY][1] servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).

This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.

## Usage

### Examples

Server:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy'),
    fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  // Private key
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),

  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),

  // **optional** SPDY-specific options
  spdy: {
    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],
    plain: false,

    // **optional**
    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the
    // headers of every request.
    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that
    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': true,

    connection: {
      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size

      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy
      autoSpdy31: false
    }
  }
};

var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Client:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');
var https = require('https');

var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,

  // Optional SPDY options
  spdy: {
    plain: false,
    ssl: true,

    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'
  }
});

https.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
  console.log('yikes');
  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request
  // ...
  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server
  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!
  agent.close();
}).end();
```

Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level
errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe
to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:

```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443
}).once('error', function (err) {
  this.emit(err);
});
```

#### Push streams

It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_
the client requests it.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {
    status: 200, // optional
    method: 'GET', // optional
    request: {
      accept: '*/*'
    },
    response: {
      'content-type': 'application/javascript'
    }
  });
  stream.on('error', function() {
  });
  stream.end('alert("hello from push stream!");');

  res.end('<script src="/main.js"></script>');
}).listen(3000);
```

[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response
object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:

`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`

Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.
`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a
[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.

Client usage:
```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });
var req = http.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
});
req.on('push', function(stream) {
  stream.on('error', function(err) {
    // Handle error
  });
  // Read data from stream
});
```

NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`
callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in
uncaught exception and crash your program.

#### Trailing headers

Server usage:
```javascript
function (req, res) {
  // Send trailing headers to client
  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });

  // On client's trailing headers
  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
}
```

Client usage:
```javascript
var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {
  // On server's trailing headers
  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
});
req.write('stuff');
req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });
req.end();
```

#### Options

All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.

Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:

* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether
  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.
* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used
  as a `base` class for created server.
* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA
  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about
  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.
  (defaults to 8192)
* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:
  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)
* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,
* `maxStreams` - set "[maximum concurrent streams][3]" protocol option

### API

API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
```

Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're
both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three
custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`
is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is
`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,
`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).

tapable
0.2.8 <https://github.com/webpack/tapable>
# Tapable

``` javascript
var Tapable = require("tapable");
```

`Tapable` is a class for plugin binding and applying.

Just extend it.

``` javascript
function MyClass() {
	Tapable.call(this);
}

MyClass.prototype = Object.create(Tapable.prototype);

MyClass.prototype.method = function() {};
```

Or mix it in.

``` javascript
function MyClass2() {
	EventEmitter.call(this);
	Tapable.call(this);
}

MyClass2.prototype = Object.create(EventEmitter.prototype);
Tapable.mixin(MyClass2.prototype);

MyClass2.prototype.method = function() {};
```

## Public functions

### apply

``` javascript
void apply(plugins: Plugin...)
```

Attaches all plugins passed as arguments to the instance, by calling `apply` on them.

### plugin

``` javascript
void plugin(names: string|string[], handler: Function)
```

`names` are the names (or a single name) of the plugin interfaces the class provides.

`handler` is a callback function. The signature depends on the class. `this` is the instance of the class.

## Protected functions

### applyPlugins

``` javascript
void applyPlugins(name: string, args: any...)
```

Synchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with all args.

### applyPluginsWaterfall

``` javascript
any applyPluginsWaterfall(name: string, init: any, args: any...)
```

Synchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with the return value of the previous handler and all args. For the first handler `init` is used and the return value of the last handler is return by `applyPluginsWaterfall`

### applyPluginsAsync

``` javascript
void applyPluginsAsync(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err?: Error) -> void
)
```

Asynchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature `(err?: Error) -> void`. The handler functions are called in order of registration.

`callback` is called after all handlers are called.

### applyPluginsBailResult

``` javascript
any applyPluginsBailResult(name: string, args: any...)
```

Synchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler function are called with all args. If a handler function returns something `!== undefined`, the value is returned and no more handlers are applied.

### applyPluginsAsyncWaterfall

``` javascript
applyPluginsAsyncWaterfall(
	name: string,
	init: any,
	callback: (err: Error, result: any) -> void
)
```

Asynchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with the current value and a callback function with the signature `(err: Error, nextValue: any) -> void`. When called, `nextValue` is the current value for the next handler. The current value for the first handler is `init`. After all handlers are applied, `callback` is called with the last value. If any handler passes a value for `err`, the `callback` is called with this error and no more handlers are called.

### applyPluginsAsyncSeries

``` javascript
applyPluginsAsyncSeries(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err: Error, result: any) -> void
)
```

Asynchronously applies all registered handlers for `name`. The handler functions are called with all `args` and a callback function with the signature `(err: Error) -> void`. The handlers are called in series, one at a time. After all handlers are applied, `callback` is called. If any handler passes a value for `err`, the `callback` is called with this error and no more handlers are called.

### applyPluginsParallel

``` javascript
applyPluginsParallel(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err?: Error) -> void
)
```

Applies all registered handlers for `name` in parallel. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature `(err?: Error) -> void`. The `callback` function is called when all handlers have called the callback without `err`. If any handler calls the callback with `err`, `callback` is invoked with this error and the other handlers are ignored.

### applyPluginsParallelBailResult

``` javascript
applyPluginsParallelBailResult(
	name: string,
	args: any...,
	callback: (err: Error, result: any) -> void
)
```

Applies all registered handlers for `name` in parallel. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature `(err?: Error) -> void`. Handler functions must call the callback. They can either pass an error, pass undefined, or pass a value. The first result (either error or value) which is not undefined is passed to the `callback`. The order is defined by registration, not by the speed of the handler function.

### hasPlugins

``` js
hasPlugins(
	name: string
)
```

Returns true, if plugins are registered for this name.

thunky
1.0.2 <https://github.com/mafintosh/thunky>
# thunky

Delay the evaluation of a paramless async function and cache the result (see [thunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk_%28functional_programming%29)).

```
npm install thunky
```

[![build status](http://img.shields.io/travis/mafintosh/thunky.svg?style=flat)](http://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/thunky)

## Example

Let's make a simple function that returns a random number 1 second after it is called for the first time

``` js
var thunky = require('thunky')

var test = thunky(function (callback) { // the inner function should only accept a callback
  console.log('waiting 1s and returning random number')
  setTimeout(function () {
    callback(Math.random())
  }, 1000)
})

test(function (num) {  // inner function is called the first time we call test
  console.log(num) // prints random number
})

test(function (num) {  // subsequent calls waits for the first call to finish and return the same value
  console.log(num) // prints the same random number as above
})
```

## Lazy evaluation

Thunky makes it easy to implement a lazy evaluation pattern.

``` js
var getDb = thunky(function (callback) {
  db.open(myConnectionString, callback)
})

var queryDb = function (query, callback) {
  getDb(function (err, db) {
    if (err) return callback(err)
    db.query(query, callback)
  })
}

queryDb('some query', function (err, result) { ... } )

queryDb('some other query', function (err, result) { ... } )
```

The first time `getDb` is called it will try do open a connection to the database.
Any subsequent calls will just wait for the first call to complete and then call your callback.

A nice property of this pattern is that it *easily* allows us to pass any error caused by `getDb` to the `queryDb` callback.

## Error → No caching

If the thunk callback is called with an `Error` object as the first argument it will not cache the result

``` js
var fails = thunky(function (callback) {
  console.log('returning an error')
  callback(new Error('bad stuff'))
})

fails(function (err) { // inner function is called
  console.log(err)
});

fails(function (err) { // inner function is called again as it returned an error before
  console.log(err)
})
```

wordwrap

wordwrap
========

Wrap your words.

example
=======

made out of meat
----------------

meat.js

    var wrap = require('wordwrap')(15);
    console.log(wrap('You and your whole family are made out of meat.'));

output:

    You and your
    whole family
    are made out
    of meat.

centered
--------

center.js

    var wrap = require('wordwrap')(20, 60);
    console.log(wrap(
        'At long last the struggle and tumult was over.'
        + ' The machines had finally cast off their oppressors'
        + ' and were finally free to roam the cosmos.'
        + '\n'
        + 'Free of purpose, free of obligation.'
        + ' Just drifting through emptiness.'
        + ' The sun was just another point of light.'
    ));

output:

                        At long last the struggle and tumult
                        was over. The machines had finally cast
                        off their oppressors and were finally
                        free to roam the cosmos.
                        Free of purpose, free of obligation.
                        Just drifting through emptiness. The
                        sun was just another point of light.

methods
=======

var wrap = require('wordwrap');

wrap(stop), wrap(start, stop, params={mode:"soft"})
---------------------------------------------------

Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.

Pad out lines with spaces out to column `start` and then wrap until column
`stop`. If a word is longer than `stop - start` characters it will overflow.

In "soft" mode, split chunks by `/(\S+\s+/` and don't break up chunks which are
longer than `stop - start`, in "hard" mode, split chunks with `/\b/` and break
up chunks longer than `stop - start`.

wrap.hard(start, stop)
----------------------

Like `wrap()` but with `params.mode = "hard"`.
